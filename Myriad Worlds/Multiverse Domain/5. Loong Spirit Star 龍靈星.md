At night, the peaks glow with a faint, otherworldly light, a testament to the cosmic energies that flow through them.
According to legend, the first dragon, Loong Tian, emerged from the heart of these mountains. It is said that Loong Tian, guided by the sky gods, forged the first dragon city from the very rocks of the mountain, imbuing it with immense power. This city, now known as Tianlong City, remains the political and cultural center of the dragon race.

The river, with its crystal-clear waters, meanders through the gorge, providing a perfect habitat for various aquatic creatures. The dragons often leap from the cliffs, their scales glistening in the sunlight as they dive into the depths below.
It is said that in ancient times, a dragon named Loong Feng discovered the gorge and claimed it as his training ground. Loong Feng was known for his unparalleled agility and hunting skills, which he honed in this very gorge. His legacy lives on, and young dragons still come here to test their mettle and prove their worth.

The Crystal Spirit Lake glimmers under the sunlight, its surface reflecting a myriad of colors. The cliffs around the lake are perfect for dragons to showcase their flying skills, and the area is often filled with the sounds of dragons in flight.
According to legend, the Crystal Spirit Lake was formed from the tears of a celestial dragon named Loong Yue. Loong Yue wept for the suffering of the world, and her tears filled the lake, imbuing it with powerful healing properties. The lake has since become a sacred place, where dragons come to heal and meditate.
- **Loong God Forest**: Loong God Forest, located in the southwestern part of Loong Spirit Star, is an ancient and primeval forest inhabited by numerous rare creatures. The forest is covered in eternal mist and filled with naturally luminescent plants that emit a faint blue glow at night.
The forest is a place of deep mystery and awe. Towering ancient trees, their trunks covered in glowing moss, create a canopy that filters the sunlight into a myriad of ethereal beams. At night, the luminescent plants light up the forest in a soft blue glow, creating an otherworldly atmosphere. The air is thick with the scent of rich earth and the sounds of hidden creatures.
Legend has it that the Loong God Forest was once the domain of a powerful dragon deity named Loong Shen. Loong Shen was a guardian of nature and all its creatures, and his spirit is said to still dwell in the forest, guiding and protecting it. The forest is also the site of many ancient rituals and ceremonies, where the dragon race seeks the blessings of Loong Shen.
